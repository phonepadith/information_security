# Protect yourself from this attack:
  * Use Strong Password which contains {letters(lower,upper),tokens,numbers} make it longest as possible, at least 10 letters
  * don't use your basic information in the password for example don't use your name or birthday\
        because the hacker can do a information gathering attack and get this information easily\
        then he will generate a wordlist based on this info.
  * Use 2F Authentication.
